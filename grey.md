# Onepager: Going grey

6/6/2021

Being part of mainstream society, or dropping out and off the grid (all the grids) are not acceptable. The former contributes to the demise of our culture, our environment and the world (and more importantly, your sanity), while the latter is impossible (to do correctly). 

In between, there is the option of going grey: Becoming the average of all possible people in all possible ways. Going grey means you don't quit facebook. Rather you have a facebook account, post innane bullshit (that everybody posts) and you never use facebook. It is enough to have you appear to be a part of society (and therefore under the control mechanisms of society), but as you spend almost no energy, time, nor emotional effort to "play the part" it affords you the space to operate. This is the basis of the grey man strategy.
