Kim Stanley Robinson, 2020. **The ministry for the future**
- Finished 8/27/21. Black Ops taking out the kleptocs was an interesting take. Far too much hope on the myth of technology saving us from ourselves. 

Andy Weir, 2020. **Project Hail Mary**
- Not as good as The Martian (but what is). Of course, science FTW, but it's low prob outcome * low prob outcomes all the way thru.
