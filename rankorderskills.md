1. State problem/opportunity of interest, in terms of decisions to be made and possible outcomes.
2. To support (1), determine what data to collect and how to get it.
3. Gather data
4. Explore data: cleaning, filtering, selecting, shaping, re-shaping, aligning, joining, imputing, re-coding, transforming, graphing, aggregating, comparing.
5. Preliminary modeling
6. Frame results in light of (1).
7. Iterate (3-6).
8. Act/Publish (to decision makers).
9. Respond to feedback from (8).
10. Stage in databases, make robust, automate.
11. Profit. 

NB Coding boot camps, Kaggle competitions and job interviewer questions focus on (5). Too bad.
